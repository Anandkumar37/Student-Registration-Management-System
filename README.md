# Student-Registration-Management-System
The Student Registration Management System is a simple web-based application designed to manage student records. This project allows users to add, update, delete, and view student records using an intuitive user interface. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes the browser's localStorage to persist data across sessions.

Key Features:
Add Records: Users can add new student records by entering the student's name, age, and email address.
Edit Records: Existing records can be edited and updated with new information.
Delete Records: Users can delete a student record, with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions.
Validation: The system checks for duplicate email addresses to ensure each student record is unique.
Responsive Design: The interface is responsive, ensuring usability across various devices.
This project is ideal for beginners learning web development, especially in handling form submissions, data validation, and utilizing local storage for data persistence.
